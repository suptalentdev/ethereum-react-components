# Ethereum React Components

A library of frequently used Ethereum components.

All available components can be found in the the project [storybook](https://ethereum.github.io/ethereum-react-components).

WARNING: this lib is not production ready. All component APIs are in exploratory phases and strict semantic versioning is not yet enforced.

## Installation

Our CI automatically bundles and publishes the latest production version to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethereum-react-components) and [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-react-components/releases)

```
yarn add ethereum-react-components
```

## Usage

```
import { Identicon } from 'ethereum-react-components';

<div>
  <Identicon address="0xF5A5d5c30BfAC14bf207b6396861aA471F9A711D" />
</div>
```

See the project [storybook](https://ethereum.github.io/ethereum-react-components?selectedKind=Widgets%2FIdenticon) for detailed documentation.
